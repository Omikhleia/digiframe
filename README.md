# (Item-)framing modpack

A minetest modpack with various item framing utilities with a 
common API.

> Existing mods such as itemframes (homedecor), anvil, sci-fi nodes
> etc. all include some similar pieces of code to display items, 
> but it is usually a walled garden that cannot be easily reused.
> This modpack aims at providing an API for mod developers to possibly
> register their own item-framing constructs, with extended features.

Besides the [framing_api](framing_api/README.md) API, it provides several secondary mods
that you may enable or not in your world, depending on your needs:
- [digiframe](digiframe/README.md): digiline-enabled item frames
- [tubeframe](tubeframe/README.md): pipeworks tube-enabled item frames

## Installing

Unpack the modpack into one of the directories where Minetest looks for mods.
